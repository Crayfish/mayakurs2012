FluidShape clouds:

To increase the fluidShape container size: 
Attributes/Container Properties/Size
Also make sure to increase the Resolution a bit (not too much or performance will take a huge hit) or the clouds will look crappy when using large container sizes.

To make the cloud texture appear smaller/bigger go to Attributes/Textures/Texture Scale

To reduce/increase the "amount" of clouds (i.E. make them more dense or more scattered/small) go to Attributes/Shading/Opacity and move around the sliders in the Diagram. 
Generally, the bigger the highlighted area in the diagram is, the denser the clouds will be. Move the sliders more towards the bottom right to create smaller, scattered clouds.

To change the color/tone of the clouds, play around with the Shading/Color settings
